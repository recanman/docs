{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"title":"AgoraDesk/LocalMonero API docs","version":"1.10","description":"# Introduction\n\n## What this API covers\n**AgoraDesk and LocalMonero share the same API.** All of the accounts, balances, ads, trades, *etc* are shared. Therefore, any changes made to AgoraDesk will be reflected on LocalMonero, and vice versa. \n\nThe base url for this API is `https://agoradesk.com/api/v1/`. Even if you only trade on LocalMonero, that's the URL you use to manage your LocalMonero actions.\n\n## Authentication\n\nSome endpoints can be requested without authentication. However, for most endpoints you'll need to **add the `Authorization` HTTP header** with your API key to all your requests. That's all you need for authenticating.\n\nYou can generate your API key on your settings page under the \"API key\" tab. That key will expire in 5 years or if you generate a new one (or delete it). Once generated, you can always find your API key on your settings page.\n\n## Differences from the LocalBitcoins API\n\nWe've tried to model our API after LocalBitcoins API as closely as possible. That means that almost all of the URLs, request and response bodies, query parameters, *etc* are identical to LocalBitcoins API. We've done this to ease the transition of existing LocalBitcoins trading bots and apps to our API. If you have your own LocalBitcoins trading bot, repurposing it to this API should be as easy as changing the base URL, authentication logic and making a few more small tweaks - **the exact differences from the LocalBitcoins API are listed in each endpoint's description**. If no differences are mentioned, then there are no differences.\n\nNote, error codes and error messages are completely different from the LocalBitcoins API.\n\n### Endpoints that exist in the LocalBitcoins API but DON'T exist in the AgoraDesk/LocalMonero API\nSome endpoints that exist in the LocalBitcoins API are not applicable to this API. Below is the list of endpoinst that **this API doesn't have**:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>View the list of non-existent endpoints</summary>\n  \n* `/pincode`, we don't use a PIN code, funds are sent with password instead;\n* `/real_name_verifiers/{username}`\n\n* `/contact_release_pin/{contact_id}`, we don't use a PIN code, trades can simply be released;\n* `/contact_mark_realname/{contact_id}`\n* `/contact_mark_identified/{contact_id}`\n\n* `/api/places/`, we use latitude and longitutde instead;\n\n* `/buy-bitcoins-with-cash/{location_id}/{location_slug}/.json`, use `/buy-bitcoins-with-cash/{currencycode}/{countrycode}/{lat}/{lon}`  instead;\n* `/sell-bitcoins-for-cash/{location_id}/{location_slug}/.json`, use `/sell-bitcoins-with-cash/{currencycode}/{countrycode}/{lat}/{lon}`  instead;\n* `/buy-bitcoins-online/{countrycode}/{country_name}/{payment_method}/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/buy-bitcoins-online/{countrycode}/{country_name}/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/buy-bitcoins-online/{payment_method}/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/buy-bitcoins-online/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/sell-bitcoins-online/{countrycode}/{country_name}/{payment_method}/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/sell-bitcoins-online/{countrycode}/{country_name}/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/sell-bitcoins-online/{payment_method}/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/sell-bitcoins-online/.json`, can't be used since we require a currency to be specified for searches;\n* `/bitcoincharts/{currency}/trades.json`\n* `/bitcoincharts/{currency}/orderbook.json`\n\n* `/api/wallet-send-pin/`, funds are sent with password instead;\n* `/bitcoinaverage/ticker-all-currencies/`\n</details>\n\n\n## Making a request\n\nAny POST request you make **must** be in JSON format and have the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header.\n\nAdditionaly, you *must* have a `User-Agent` header set. The User-Agent **must** specify that this is a bot, otherwise the request might get blocked.\n\n## Understanding the response\n\nIf a request was completed successfully, you'll get the requested data under the `data` key. The response will look something like this:\n```\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"outgoing_fee\": \"0.00015000\"\n    }\n}\n```\nor\n```\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"message\": \"Message sent successfully.\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou'll find an example response for each endpoint in these docs.\n\n### Pagination\n\nIf there are too many values within `data` to return at once the results will be paginated. In that case you'll receive the `pagination` object, which will be on the same level as the `data` object. Like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"ad_count\": 20,\n        \"ad_list\": [\n           \"Many ads here...\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"pagination\": {\n        \"next\": \"https://agoradesk.com/api/v1/buy-monero-online/HKD?page=2\"\n        \"prev\": \"https://agoradesk.com/api/v1/buy-monero-online/HKD?page=0\"\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can either use `pagination.next` or `pagination.prev` for navigation, or simply add the `page` query parameter yourself - just note that the first page is `0`, the second page is `1` and so on.\n\n### Errors\n\nIf there was an error with your request, you are not going to receive the `data` key. The response is going to have the `error` uppermost key and the appropriate HTTP status code. You can use that to tell apart successful requests from failed requests.\n\nThere are two types of errors: **validation** errors and **enumerated** errors.\n\n#### Validation errors\n\nA validation error means that your request data didn't match our allowed format. In that case you'll see a response like this:\n```\n{\n    \"error\": {\n        \"validation\": {\n            \"currency\": \"Invalid currency in query - please check your request!\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIf more than one of your request parameters have failed, they'll all be listed within the `validation` obect.\nEach key name within the `validation` object corresponds with the name of the param that hasn't passed the validation.\n\n#### Enumerated errors\n\nThese errors mean that you're doing something wrong. For example, you're trying to start a trade for an ad that doesn't exist. In that case, you'll see the following:\n```\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"error_code\": 97,\n    \"message\": \"Trying to create a trade for ad that doesn’t exist\"\n  }\n}\n```\nAll of the error codes applicable to each endpoint are listed in each endpoint's description.\n\nSome errors might occur on any request, such as:\n\n* **13**: *Something went wrong on the request. It's most likely a validation issue. Check your request parameters, and if this still doesn't seem right, please contact our support.*\n* **401**: *You need to be authenticated to perform this action.*\n* **403**: *You are not authorized to perform this action*\n* **404**: *Requested endpoint wasn't found.*\n* **415**: *Unsupported Media Type ('Content-Type' must be application/json)*\n* **429**: *You are making too many requests. Try again after some time.*\n\n## Existing API wrapper libraries\n*Please note that these libraries are unofficial and in no way affiliated with AgoraDesk/LocalMonero.

You can read more about it [here](https://agoradesk.com/blog/announcements/fully-non-custodial-trade-settlements). This means breaking API changes have been introduced as follows:\n      \n* `/contact_create/{ad_id}`: New required property `buyer_settlement_address` for starting trades from `*_SELL` ads.      \n* `/ad-create`: New required property `buyer_settlement_address` for creating `*_BUY` ads.      \n* `/ad/{ad_id}`: New non-nullable property `buyer_settlement_address` for updating `*_BUY` ads.\n* `/wallet` and `/wallet/XMR`: New proprety `related_trade_url` added to transaction objects of outgoing transactions associated with settling a trade.\n* `/trade/contact_release/{trade_id}`: A `password` is now required to release a trade.\n* `/contact_info/{trade_id}`: New properties `transfer_to_buyer_settlement_wallet_transaction_id` (both parties),\n`transfer_to_buyer_settlement_wallet_transaction_key` (both parties),\n`buyer_settlement_address` (both parties), `seller_non_custodial_wallet_mnemonic` (seller only),\n`transfer_to_seller_non_custodial_wallet_transaction_id` (seller only) and `arbitrated` (both parties).\n\n### 2022-01-13: v1.7\nThis update concerns BTC fee levels - now you can choose which fee level should trades be settled with, as well as now you will get a more precise BTC withdrawal fee amount estimation. \n\n* `/contact_create/{ad_id}`: New required property `buyer_settlement_fee_level` for starting trades from BTC `*_SELL` ads. \n* `/ad-create`: New required property `buyer_settlement_fee_level` for creating BTC `*_BUY` ads.\n* `/ad/{ad_id}`: New non-nullable property `buyer_settlement_fee_level` for updating BTC `*_BUY` ads.\n* `/fees`: New optional `address` query parameter which allows for more precise fee amount estimation.

The urls are complete and can be used as is.\n* The `created_at` and other `*_at` properties are an ISO formatted UTC datetime.\n* The `amount` (denominated in `currency`), `amount_btc` or `amount_xmr`, and `premium` properties are string representations of\ndecimals, both set at the time of creation of the trade. \n* `is_buying` and `is_selling` are shortcuts that indicate that the token owner is the buyer or seller in\nthis trade.\n* `canceled_at`, `escrowed_at`, `funded_at`, `disputed_at`, `closed_at` and `released_at` are all\neither datetimes or `null`, reflecting the progress of the trade. Once a trade enters a\nstate (a datetime is set) it will never unset the state.\n* In case the underlying ad was deleted, properties `actions.advertisement_public_view`, `actions.advertisement_url` and `advertisement.id` won't be returned.\n* The response will contain settlement-related properties, such as `transfer_to_buyer_settlement_wallet_transaction_id` (both parties),\n`transfer_to_buyer_settlement_wallet_transaction_key` (both parties),\n`buyer_settlement_address` (both parties), `seller_non_custodial_wallet_mnemonic` (seller only),\n`transfer_to_seller_non_custodial_wallet_transaction_id` (seller only). Once trade is released and settlement is finished, they will all hold relevant values, otherwise they'll be `null`. \n* `arbitrated` will return `true` in case the trade was resolved via administrator arbitration, in which case the abovementioned settlement-related propertie will remain `null`.\n\n\n## Differences from LocalBitcoins API\n* The errors that are returned by this endpoint are completely different from those returned by LocalBitcoins, consult the \"Possible errors\" section.:\n* properties `reference_code`, `account_details`, `exchange_rate_updated_at`, `real_name`, `company_name`, `countrycode_by_ip`, `countrycode_by_phone_number` **don't** exist.\n* depending on the asset of the trade, properties are either called `amount_btc` and `fee_btc` or `amount_xmr` and `fee_xmr`.\n* `advertisement` object will also have the `asset` property equal to either `\"BTC\"` or `\"XMR\"`.\n* `msg` property carries the terms of the trade at the moment of the trade's creation.\n* The trade object will contain settlement-related properties.\n* New `arbitrated` property.\n\n## Possible errors   \n* Validation errors.\n* **115**: *Trade by requested ID doesn’t
